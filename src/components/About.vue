    <h2>About Limited Audience</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Limited Audience, Fashionable Bondage. This site collects material that was shot over one and a half decades. All of it was rigged, shot, and lovingly edited by myself, Frank. It features both professional and amateur models, but all of them were a joy to work with, and I'm forever proud of the amazing work we've done together.</p>

    <p>Each trailer contains one or more links to places you can purchase the full video. You have my and my models' gratitude for each and every purchase!</p>
    <p>What started as a bondage tribute site in 2000, grew to one of the world's oldest bondage sites. Since the beginning it has featured original and unique content. It has gone through a multitude of redesigns over that time, and this is its latest incarnation&mdash;as easy to use on mobiles, as on tablets or desktop computers.</p>
    <p>Be sure to check back often&mdash;I have so much more material to put online!</p>
